# OpenGRC Framework (OPENGRCRMF)

An open-source, documentation-first framework designed to model and modernize cybersecurity governance execution across NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) workflows, Authorization to Operate (ATO) lifecycle artifacts, and Zero Trust alignment for federal and regulated environments.

---

## Overview

The OpenGRC Framework provides an automation-ready modeling approach for structured compliance execution aligned with:

- NIST Risk Management Framework (NIST SP 800-37)
- NIST Special Publication 800-53 (Release 5.2.0 or subsequent revisions)
- ATO lifecycle artifacts (SSP, SAP, SAR, POA&M, Continuous Monitoring)
- Zero Trust Architecture principles
- DevSecOps-integrated compliance telemetry

The framework does not replace federal standards or statutory requirements. Instead, it structures governance artifacts and workflows as interconnected, traceable data objects to improve lifecycle transparency and reduce documentation fragmentation.

---

## Problem Context

In many regulated environments, compliance execution remains:

- Spreadsheet-driven
- Document-centric rather than workflow-driven
- Disconnected from real-time security telemetry
- Fragmented across multiple tools

These structural inefficiencies can:

- Delay ATO timelines
- Increase administrative overhead
- Reduce risk visibility
- Limit integration between Zero Trust telemetry and RMF documentation

The OpenGRC Framework models governance workflows to enable:

- Artifact traceability
- Structured evidence lifecycle management
- Continuous monitoring integration
- Vendor-neutral extensibility
- Zero Trust governance alignment

## Core Modules

### 1. RMF Workflow Model
Structured modeling of:

- Categorize  
- Select  
- Implement  
- Assess  
- Authorize  
- Monitor  

### 2. ATO Artifact Lifecycle
Data-driven modeling of:

- System Security Plan (SSP)

- Evidence mapping and telemetry linkage
- Cross-framework expansion (future phases)

### 4. DevSecOps Integration Specifications
API-ready modeling for:

- CI/CD telemetry ingestion
- Vulnerability scan integration

## Roadmap

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for dated milestones and phased releases.

Planned release sequence:

- v0.1 – Alpha Documentation
- v0.2 – Integration & Schema Specification
- v0.3 – Public Beta Documentation
- v1.0 – Framework Maturity Milestone

---

## Differentiation

Unlike many proprietary GRC platforms, the OpenGRC Framework emphasizes:

- Workflow-driven lifecycle modeling
- Structured control-to-evidence mapping
- Vendor-neutral integration architecture
- Explicit Zero Trust governance alignment
- Open-source transparency
- Documentation-first extensibility

The objective is structural modernization of compliance execution rather than product replacement.
